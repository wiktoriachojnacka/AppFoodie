Application for android devices written in java. This is a project that I created for my studies. Support for writing the application was a tutorial.

## App main page appearance after launch

On the home page, when you launch the application, you will see a list of random recipes that can be scrolled down, a button that allows you to "create an account," a button that displays the categories of recipes by which you can search, and a searchbar.

## App sign up / register page appearance after launch

After hitting the "create account" button, a page will be displayed where you can log in or register. Registration consists in adding username and password to the database, so that when you log in you will see a message whether the password and login are correct or not.

## App recipe details appearance after launch

When you select a recipe, it will display a photo of the recipe, a brief description and instructions on how to make the meal and the ingredients needed to make it.
